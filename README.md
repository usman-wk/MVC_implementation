# ðŸŽ“ Student GPA Analyzer (Java - MVC Pattern)

A simple Java application that follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern to manage and analyze student GPA data. This project demonstrates how to structure a Java program using clean, modular code.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This application allows you to:
- Add student records (name and GPA).
- Calculate the average GPA.
- Display all student records.
- Filter and show students **above** and **below** the average GPA.

It's an educational project aimed at helping beginners understand how MVC architecture works in Java.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- MVC Design Pattern
- Java Collections (`List`)
- Data Aggregation and Filtering
- Modular Code Structure (3-Tier Packaging)

â””â”€â”€ Main.java

````

- `model/`: Contains the `Student` class and `StudentModel` for business logic.
- `view/`: Responsible for displaying data in the console.
- `controller/`: Coordinates between model and view.
- `Main.java`: Entry point of the application.
